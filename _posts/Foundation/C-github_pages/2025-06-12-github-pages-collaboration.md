# Collaboration & Teamwork in Web Development

In real-world software development, working together is just as important as writing code. This guide covers key collaboration tools and workflows, especially **VSCode Live Share**, **Git-based teamwork**, and **pair programming**.

## VSCode Live Share

VSCode Live Share lets you collaborate in real time. You and your teammates can edit, debug, and even use the terminal together — all from your own devices.

### How to Use Live Share

1. **Install the Live Share extension** in VSCode.
2. Click the **Live Share** button in the bottom bar to start a session.
3. Share the invite link with your partner(s).
4. Teammates can join and collaborate in your coding environment.
5. Use shared terminal, servers, and debugging tools together.

Live Share is perfect for:
- Pair programming
- Mentoring or tutoring
- Remote debugging
- Collaborative review sessions

## Pair Programming Strategies

Pair programming is when two developers work together at one workstation — one codes ("driver"), and the other reviews and guides ("navigator").

### How to Do It

- One person writes code, the other watches, gives ideas, and catches bugs.
- After 10–15 minutes, **switch roles**.
- Keep communication active and respectful.
- Use **Live Share** so you can work from separate computers.

### When to Pair Program vs Split Tasks

#### Split Work By Features (Best for Teams of 3+)

- Divide features logically: e.g., one person works on login, another on leaderboard, a third on game logic.
- Use branches to avoid merge conflicts.
- Later, **merge and integrate** your parts.

#### Pair Program When…

- Working on tricky features like auth or backend logic
- Debugging something complex
- Reviewing code before a big push

## Git Collaboration Basics

Version control is your safety net for team coding.

### Git Concepts to Know

- **Branching**: Work independently without breaking main
- **Pull requests**: Share and review changes before merging
- **Commit messages**: Make them clear and specific (`feat: add navbar`, `fix: login redirect`)
- **Conflict resolution**: Use VSCode’s merge tools and communicate often

### Tools to Use

- **GitHub**: Push/pull, open issues, and assign tasks
- **Kanban Boards**: for task tracking
- **Commits**: Use them to verify team contributions (use GitHub Insights or terminal logs)
